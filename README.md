# LawAnalyzer
This is a simple Java law analyzer that uses an artificial intelligence API to return parameters. It is my first experiment with a GPT API. This application is designed to optimize the creation of house construction law parameters.

When you run the application, it creates a given number of JSON files with successive API requests. Each request has the same prompt and input. Then, a simple normalization process is performed to obtain one normalized JSON file string for all the law parameter names. The mode is used to select the correct value.

The prompt is designed to accept multiple languages but generate the output in English. It accepts double and boolean parameters.

Use IntelliJ or another IDE to change the configuration class directly.
